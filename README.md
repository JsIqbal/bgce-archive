🧩 Tech Stack (Future Web App Vision)

If this turns into a community-driven web interface:

```bash
• Frontend: React / Svelte / Next.js / Vue
• Backend: Go
• Storage: GitHub + SQLite/Postgres
• Auth: GitHub OAuth (optional)
• Deployment: AWS
```
UI/UX ideas for the future web App
```bash
Most preferable one for now:
1. Modern Library-Style UI
   - Homepage: A clean, minimalist grid of featured archives with a search bar in the center.
   - Filters & Categories: Sidebar with quick access to categories (by year, author, tags, etc.).
   - Reading Mode: Dark/light mode toggle, distraction-free fullscreen mode.
   - Bookmarking & Notes: Users can highlight text and add personal notes to archives.
```
Other types of UI
```bash
2. Timeline-Based UI
3. Grid & Gallery UI
4. Terminal-Inspired UI
5. Tag-Based UI
6. Map-Based UI
7. AI-Assisted UI
8. Infinite Scroll vs. Pagination Debate
```

🛠️ How to Contribute to the Archive Project as a Community Member

🧩 **Not part of our community yet?**  
Join us and help build a powerful open-source knowledge vault — where developers share ideas, grow together, and make something meaningful.  
Whether you're into research, backend, frontend, or just want to learn, **there’s a place for you here.**

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Follow the steps below to get started:
1. 📣 Get Assigned to a Team

    Mention a moderator in the Discord group to request team assignment.

    By default, you'll be added to the R&D team first, since research is the foundation of the project.

    If you’re interested in contributing to Backend or Frontend, you will be assigned to those teams after completing your initial R&D phase.

    So for example, if you want to work on Backend, you will be part of R&D + Backend (once the dev phase starts).

2. ⭐️ Fork and Setup the Project

    Star the repository to show your support.

    Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

    Clone your fork locally:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/https://github.com/JsIqbal/bgce-archive.git
    ``` 
	```bash
	cd bgce-archive
	```
	    
  

3. 🔧 Make Your Changes

    Create a new branch:

   ``bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name``

   Make your changes and commit them with clear messages:

    ```bash 
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add: your contribution"
     ```

4. 🚀 Push and Submit a PR

    Push your branch:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

    Open a Pull Request (PR) from your forked repo to the main project repo.

    Wait for moderators or maintainers to review your PR. Be ready to make changes if requested.

5. 🧠 Collaborate and Improve

    Stay active in the Discord group.

    Review other contributors’ PRs if you can.
