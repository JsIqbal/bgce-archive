# 🐹 Golang Playground

Welcome to my Golang knowledge hub — a growing collection of experiments, course notes, and practical learnings as I dive deeper into Go 🚀

---

## 📂 Structure (will be updated in future)

```
golang/ 
    ├── experiment/
    └── go-with-habib-class-notes/
```

### 🔬 `experiment/`
A sandbox for all my Go experiments. From testing features to quick problem-solving attempts, this folder is all about learning by doing.

### 📘 `go-with-habib-class-notes/`
Detailed notes and example code from the **"Go with Habib"** course. Organized by class, with code and key takeaways.

---

## 📌 What's Next?

- [ ] Add more Go mini-projects and tools under `experiment/`
- [ ] Continue documenting the Habib course in markdown
- [ ] Add `README.md` for each class and experiment
- [ ] Eventually turn this entire `golang/` folder into part of the `bytebook` mdBook
